From the zeit template:
> Purgecss takes a very straightforward approach to removing unused CSS. It simply searches an entire file for a string that matches a regular expression. As a result, class strings that are dynamically created in a template using string concatenation will be considered unused and removed from your stylesheet. Tailwind CSS addresses this problem in more detail in their documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#writing-purgeable-html).
